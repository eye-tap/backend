As of now it should be possible to login / signup; List annotation sessions and upload texts and maybe even change annotation sessions (annotate).

Next we need to create upload / import of reading sessions, creation of surveys and creation of annotation sessions.
This should be enough to run initial survey.

Later we need to think about exporting, maybe think about that at importing already, s.t. we dont throw away information we will later require.
